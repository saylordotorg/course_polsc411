    2, titled “Transnational Dimensions of Social Movement Media.” 
    Listen to the entire lecture (80 minutes).  How can political
    economists explain the rise of non-nation-state actors?  In other
    words, the world is seeing a diffusion of power from nations to
    various other groups like social movements, non-government
    organizations, and activist networks.  These entities are more fluid
    and difficult to define. The speaker outlines the lengthy history of
    transnational forces.  Consider this historical context in light of
    today’s globalized environment.
