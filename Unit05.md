**Unit 5: Human Rights and Basic Needs** <span id="5"></span> 
*While some insist that globalization has lifted millions of people out
of poverty, others draw attention to the darker aspects of
globalization, such as the exploitation of laborers in poor countries
and the degradation of the environment.  Some also worry that
globalization has continued to widen the gap between rich and poor
countries.  Individuals may not benefit from increased economic
opportunity if they live in a country with high levels of corruption or
weak institutions; wealth may go directly to the pockets of officials
rather than into domestic investments capable of improving the
livelihood of the population.  Political scientists seek to address
human rights, a set of standards each individual is entitled to.  In
this unit, we will discuss the issues and controversies surrounding
globalization, human rights, and economic development.  We will also
address specific case studies.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**

    changes over time.
-   Evaluate the effectiveness of the international human rights system.

    requires Adobe Acrobat Reader, which can be downloaded free at
    Adobe’s site.  Read the entire work (75 pages). The economic and
    political gains from globalization have not been distributed
    equally.  As the world comes closer together, some nations and
    peoples have not fully participated in rising standards of living
    and may have suffered negative consequences from transnational
    policies.  In this section, we will quantify how globalization has
    contributed to inequality. Think about how the authors use
    statistics to demonstrate how income is distributed.   Do you think
    income inequality has gotten more extreme since this was written?

    questions; gender, religion, sexual orientation, economic systems,
    and race are just a handful of examples.  This section is an
    introduction to how human rights relate to basic needs. Think about
    how human rights relate to the basic needs of society.  Note how the

    rights organizational bodies.

    from Want: The Human Right to Adequate Food.” This is an Adobe
    Acrobat file that requires Adobe Acrobat Reader, which can be
    downloaded free at Adobe’s site.  Read Chapters 4 to 7 (pages
    63-142).  We have established the importance of human rights and how
    individuals are perceived.  An international human rights system
    exists to address concerns and seek solutions.  The human rights
    system does not enjoy global agreement about what constitutes a fair
    standard of treatment and access to life’s necessities.  For
    example, in one country access to affordable health care by all may
    be a bedrock principle, while in another a free market system may be
    used to allocate health care. Think about how the author links the
    various concepts of law, governance, entitlements, economic rights,
    and accountability.

    of the course, we turn our attention to case studies about human
    rights and basic needs.  The cases are diverse and address national
    policies, global standards, and specific needs.  Consider the
    various applications of human rights.  Think about how human rights
    affect the most vulnerable population (infants) and how refugees
    face unique struggles. As you complete this section, think about
    your own access to fair treatment and sufficient goods and
    services.  How might your life be different in another region of the
    world?
