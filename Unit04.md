**Unit 4: Monetary Systems and Currency Regimes** <span id="4"></span> 
*In Unit 4, you will learn about the international monetary system and
exchange rate regimes.  The globalization of trade and production has
made the international monetary system critical to the smooth operation
of the global economy.  After all, trade, debt, and investments must
ultimately be paid for with money.  In this unit, we will review
different types of money (currencies) and examine their connections and
inter-operations in the global economy.  We will also look closely at
the development of the Euro, the most extensive and successful attempt
at monetary integration in history.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 21.5 hours to complete.
