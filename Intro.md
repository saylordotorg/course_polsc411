This course will introduce you to the field of international political
economy.  International political economy combines two very important
aspects of international relations: politics and economics.  The goal of
this course is to make you aware of the ways in which economics and
politics influence each other when it comes to creating policy.  It
explores the interrelated nature of both economics (via its emphasis on
markets) and politics (via its emphasis on power).  This course is thus
both an economics and a politics course.  However, please note that
though we will review some economics concepts, this course is not an
econometrics course and does not require a background in economic
methods. Economic policy can be an important instrument of statecraft
and diplomacy between countries.  For example, countries often use trade
relationships, promises of aid, loans, and investments to build
goodwill.  On the other hand, countries can also use economic policy to
punish or express disapproval towards other countries.  The United
Nations Security Council will often, for example, use economic sanctions
as a policy instrument when a country is found to be in violation of
international law. In this course, you will also learn about the
international organizations and regimes that are designed to facilitate
international economic transactions and ensure economic stability, such
as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).  We will also review the impact that globalization has on
the world economy and the gap between rich and poor countries.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC411: International Political Economy. General
information about this course and its requirements can be found below.  
    
 **Course Designer**: Michael Mosser  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   iTunes U: Middlebury College: James Morrison’s *International
    Political Economics*
-   [*International Economics: Theory and
    Policy*](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/textbooks/International%20Economics%20-%20Theory%20and%20Policy.pdf)

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Unit One is of special importance, as it is the foundation for the more
advanced material presented in the later units. You will also need to
complete the Final Exam.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the materials in each unit.  
  
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again
following a 14-day waiting period.  
  
 **Time Commitment**: Completing this course should take you a total of
approximately **94.5** **hours**. Each unit includes a time advisory
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These advisories should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories, determine how much time
you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 16 hours.
Instead of attempting to complete the entire unit in a few sittings, it
might be useful for you to consider each subunit as a discrete entity,
only working on the subunits for which you can devote the appropriate
time and resources. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Monday night;
subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Tuesday night; subunit 1.3 (a
total of 4.5 hours) on Wednesday night; etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions**: Please follow the directions in each unit of the
course outline section to navigate through the course materials. Please
see the prerequisite and required courses in the course requirements
section above. If you are struggling with a concept, it may help to
refer back to these courses for a refresher of basic economics and
international relations concepts. It will be helpful to take careful
notes as you work through the readings, video lectures, and other
resources. These notes will be useful for studying as you prepare for
the Final Exam.
