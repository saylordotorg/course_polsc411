**Unit 2: Trade** <span id="2"></span> 
*Unit 2 will explore the ways in which domestic politics influences a
state’s policies abroad.  In Unit 1, you learned how economic policy has
been used to further state power and national interest.  In democracies,
politicians need to be elected and will therefore be reluctant to adopt
policies that may be efficient from a macroeconomic perspective but may
also inflict hardship and adjustment on the domestic economy.  For
example, it may make sound economic sense to ensure free trade in the
steel sector, but politicians would fear that they would be voted out of
office if their constituents lost their jobs, because a more efficient
steel company from abroad began to dominate the domestic market.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 26 hours to complete.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read through the entire document.  Non-tariff
    barriers are more difficult to quantify, because they use
    non-financial rules and regulations to limit trade.  In some ways,
    these kinds of barriers can be more effective, because they are
    harder to detect and overcome. Note the various kinds of non-tariff
    barriers for trade.
