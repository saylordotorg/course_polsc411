**Unit 3: Global Trade, Foreign Direct Investment and Sovereign Debt**
<span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about foreign direct investment and
sovereign debt, two distinct concepts in international political
economy.  Foreign direct investment refers to the investment of (usually
private) capital resources in the industries of another country.  Both
governments and industries in developing countries actively seek foreign
direct investment in order to substitute private capital investment for
public investment.  In poorer countries, however, public funds may be
unavailable due to the financial situation of the government.*  
  
 *Sovereign debt refers to the debt taken out or guaranteed by the
government of a country.  Governments may have to pay lower or higher
interest rates on their debt depending on their presumed
credit-worthiness.  Regime stability is also an important factor in
sovereign debt funding.*

     Instructions:  Read each section of the Introductory materials: 
    “Introduction,” “What Are the Different Kinds of Foreign
    Investment,” “Differences Between Portfolio and Direct Investment,”
    “Why Do Companies Invest Overseas,” “Concerns about Shifting
    Production Due to Foreign Investment,” “Why Has Foreign Investment
    Increased so Dramatically in Recent Decades,” and “Where Does
    Foreign Investment Take Place.” To access each section, click on the
    hyperlink after “Next” at the bottom of each webpage, or click on
    the hyperlinks under “Introduction” in the table of contents on the
    left side of the webpage.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a
    complex topic at the intersection of business, politics, finance,
    and economics.  As the world has become globalized, firms can more
    easily invest in foreign markets.  Some companies may even be
    considered as transnational, owing little allegiance to any single
    country. Think about how foreign direct investment has changed the
    competitive landscape for nations over the past decade.

    FDI is somewhat controversial, because its effects are not uniform
    across a society.  For example, employment may be increased;
    however, gains from jobs may be distributed unequally. Think about
    how you might weigh the costs and benefits of FDI in your own
    country.

    Paper” near the bottom of the page.  This is an Adobe Acrobat file
    that requires Adobe Acrobat Reader, which can be downloaded free at
    Adobe’s Site.  Read the entire paper, but consider the role of debt
    in building a society.  Like individuals, countries borrow to
    finance present consumption today at the expense of repayments
    tomorrow.  This process can empower countries to build important
    infrastructure or pursue economic stabilization programs.  The
    significant risk is that countries may over-borrow, and this can
    affect future economic growth.  Also, when a regime changes, ethical
    questions emerge about who should ultimately be responsible for this
    debt. Are stolen funds the responsibility of the general public?
